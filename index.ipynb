    "# Best joint account accounts to use\n",
    "To access the notebook and codes, you can access it through this [repo](https://github.com/zhyoung17/joint-account).\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo will analyse different joint accounts to use for various scenarios. In this ipynb file, I will examine and use the most ideal joint account for fresh graduates who are earning around the median starting salary of ~ S$4,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is NOT financial advice, but instead just a data analyst who is in the same scenario. Use the bank accounts at your own discretion and not mine. Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use a joint account?\n",
    "As a couple, we need to aim to maximise our cash in a low-risk environment to ensure that we are able to use it for our own future needs. One example is to use the cash for BTO, where cash might be needed for renovations and furnishing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why not use our own accounts? This is up to personal preference. Personally, it gives a sense of financial ownership where couples are able to pay off shared expenses through a shared account. Moreover, the joint account ensures that the money is transparent for both parties to access too, so less bickering about who-pays-what.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you might be wondering if it is better off to invest the money into an index fund or SPY ETF to maximise your interest. Yes! The SPY provides a steady YOY return as compared to a savings fund (11.98% vs 2.80%). But of course you must understand that a joint account is not an investment account. The purpose of a joint account is to ensure that the money within is liquid and accessible to both parties. These criterias are not met in an ETF or index fund."

Some might find the petrol cashback of the OCBC 360 to be more suitable for their needs, which others love the high miles to cash ratio of UOB. "
