# Joint Account Analysis

In the main file, I will be analysing the different saving accounts in Singapore, and choose the most ideal accouint for joint accounts. A joint account is defined as an account that has two contributors contributing a fixed amount of money every month. The goal is to maximise the interest rates, while ensuring liquidity.

Please note that this is NOT financial advice, but instead just a data analyst who is in the same scenario. Use the bank accounts at your own discretion and not mine. Enjoy!
